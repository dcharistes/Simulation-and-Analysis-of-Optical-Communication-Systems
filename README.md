# Simulation and Analysis of Optical Communication Systems

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for simulating **optical communication systems**, focusing on signal modulation, transmission through optical fiber, and **Bit Error Rate (BER) analysis**. The simulations include **Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM)**, signal shaping, propagation through fiber channels, and noise analysis.

## Installation Instructions

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
It is highly recommended to use a **virtual environment (venv)** to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with system-wide Python packages.

#### For Windows (Bash):
```powershell
python -m venv .env
source .env\Scripts\activate
```

---

### 2. Install Dependencies
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies using `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage
After setting up the environment and installing dependencies, you can run the simulation scripts.

```bash
python opticalCommTask1.py
```
